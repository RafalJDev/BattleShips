# BATTLE SHIPS PROJECT

##### We are pretty sure that you know what is Battle Ships Game, but if not here is simple guide https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)

### Requirements (if you want to run game server locally):
* Maven >= 3.x 
* Java >= 1.8


### How to run:
1. Pull project form github ```git clone https://github.com/gacikjakub/BattleShips ```
2. Go into directory with project ```cd BattleShips```
3. Execute run script ```./run.sh```
If it does not work probably script is not executable. Make this by ```chmod +x run.sh```
If you cannot start application, because default port 8080 is busy you can start application by ```./run.sh <ANOTHER_PORT>``` ie. ```./run.sh 8081```
4. Open your browser and type as url ```localhost:8080``` (or instead of 8080 <YOUR_PORT>)
4. Have fun !
